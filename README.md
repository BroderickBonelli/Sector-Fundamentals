# Sector-Fundamentals

Scrape fundamental ratios from the web for all stocks in a specific S&P 500 sector.
Graph this data in a pandas dataframe, and visually rank each company against each other by each metric with a red, yellow, green heatmap system (red = bad, green = good)

This is a quick way to gauge which stocks are the strongest/weakest in a sector from a fundamental perspective. 
I used to do this manually as part of my investment research process, this tool has saved me hours and hours.
