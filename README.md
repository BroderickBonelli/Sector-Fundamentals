# Sector-Fundamentals

Scrape fundamental ratios from the web for all stocks in a specific S&P 500 sector.
Graph this data in a pandas dataframe, and visually rank each company against each other by each metric with a red, yellow, green heatmap system (red = bad, green = good)

This is a quick way to gauge which stocks are the strongest/weakest in a sector from a fundamental perspective. 
I used to do this manually as part of my investment research process, this tool has saved me hours and hours. 

Note: the dataframe showing in the .ipynb file is not applying the heatmap function, when you run the full cell in jupyter notebook it applies correctly. See the jpeg image for what the final result will look like.
